# Sonic 1 SMS Remake Vita

A port of the fangame **Sonic 1 SMS Remake** for the **PSVita**.

Official PC and Android versions on: **sonic-sms-remake.blogspot.com**

**Expected bugs and issues:**

1. Some PC exclusive features have been removed.
2. **Expect Scrap Brain Act 2 to be a little laggy due to the big size of the level.**
3. If you leave the game idleing for too long, it will eventually crash. This is not related to the game (afaik), but related to the GMS Vita executable.
   Just be sure to press the PS button before turning off the screen of the console to leave it in standby.
   
**PSTV Compatibility:**

1. Expect a little more lag due to the big size of the levels and the PSTV running at a superior resolution.
2. On PSTV, the game doesn't crash like it does in the PSVita systems.

**Update 22/10/2021**: Fixed Retro screen mode.

**Big Special Thanks to cubeww, m1s3ry, SilicaAndPina and KuromeSan.**
